            <p style="font-weight: 700;padding-left:8pt;"><em>“With the idea that every individual wants to live a meaningful and memorable life, how do we best choose to remember our past?”</em></p>
            <p>Photographs are meant to capture a moment in time; it encapsulates that moment. Photographs contain all the emotions and feelings as they were when that moment of time was solidified in time.</p>

            <p>When you look at the blank, somewhat distorted polaroid I assume is in front of you, what do you see? What moment is that photograph capturing? That blank photograph is capturing whatever you see; it means whatever you want it to mean.</p>

            <p>With this said, I ask you to upload a picture, here to this website, to create your own "polaroid". Upload your "polaroid" on Instagram with <em>#BigReadStories</em> to share it with others, and view it along side others on the display I again assume is in front of you.</p>
            <p><em>Thank You</em></p>
